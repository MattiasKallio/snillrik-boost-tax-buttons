# snillrik-boost-tax-buttons
In the Boost plugin there are alredy a tax toggle-function. This just adds a shortcode that can be used to display two buttons for Business or Private.
I used it in a popup to make one of those "busniess or private" -thingie for when someone enters the site.

##3 Use it like this:
[snpopjboost_tax_shortcode business="Is U Bizniz?" private="Or am U perzon?"]

That's it. Might be the simples plugin I have done. :)
